Random Decisions I make
- doing routing client side via react-router-doms

- Determine if securing views from client side or flask and implement
  role based access to the views

Deploying
Need to seperate environment variables from being in .flaskenv file


Features:
- could do something like help me plan my week based on weather and time 
and varying activites etc (GPT could help a lot or do it for me)
